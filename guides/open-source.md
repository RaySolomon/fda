# What does the FDA think of open source projects?

There are not many open-source medical projects in existence currently; if they do exist, they tend to focus on academic use-cases, such as the [Cheapstat][1], [OpenPCR][2]. Other "maker" devices, such as the [ehealth sensor kit](http://www.cooking-hacks.com/ehealth-sensors-complete-kit-biometric-medical-arduino-raspberry-pi), are not usable for anything except the most basic of tasks, and are not even close to being under the guidance of the FDA.

The best resource for the FDA's opinion is probably the [Nightscout project](https://nightscout.github.io/). Their [fda-presubmission](https://github.com/nightscout/fda-presubmission) repository documents their attempt at open discussion with the FDA regarding the legality of the Nightscout CGM system. The even had a [meeting on October 8, 2014](https://github.com/nightscout/fda-presubmission/blob/master/source/07-minutes.rst) with the FDA - the minutes from that meeting are probably the most useful and up-to-date resource on the FDA's thinking (when taken in conjunction with the official FDA documents, of course.

Some quotes:

> FDA provided some initial comments to emphasize that FDA doesn't have a bias against the open source route

> FDA emphasized that a key tenet of device regulation is that some entity be responsible for assuring the safety and effectiveness of the device and that postmarket safety is adequately monitored and that any potential problems are adequately addressed

> The FDA hears the demand from patients for devices like Nightscout to exist, and doesn’t have a particular problem with safe and effective devices of this kind coming to market. In fact, they want to make this happen faster.

> The group discussed FDA’s desire that there be a single responsible party to ensure that nothing falls through the cracks. The FDA emphasized the need for one party to take responsibility. For example, change control to determine when updates were ready to be implemented to general users, what problems need to be addressed and on what timeline, etc. should be adequately addressed.
