# Molecular Diagnostic Instruments with Combined Functions

The MDICF is for any device that "measures or characterizes nucleic acid analytes and has combinded functions." Some useful definitions and abbreviations (&sect;I) (you'll need to refer back to these later):

Combined functions
: are instruments that serve as a component of an FDA-cleared or approved IVD system but can also be configured by the user for other test purposes, such as basic research.

Approved/cleared
: refers to instruments and functions requiring approval through the PMA process or clearance through the 510(k) process.
: refers to both PMA approval and 510(k) approval.

Approval/clearance is not required
: refers to instruments or functions that do not need to be approved or cleared by the FDA, such as those intended solely for use for basic research.

Should
: means something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

IVDs
: *in vitro* diagnostic devices.

It is important to note that the FDA's guidance documents do not establish and legally enforceable rules. "Unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited," [they are only guidelines.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6kgS_AwuH0)

## General Guidelines

This document **does not** refer to assays and reagents; for RUO and IUO assays for clinical use, see ["Distribution of In Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only or Investigational Use Only: Frequently Asked Questions"](http//www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm253307.htm).

This document **does not** refer to blood screenings (e.g. for donors); see the Center for Biologics Evaluation Research.

> **Questions:** 
> 
> - What is the definition of 'basic research'?
> - Where are the legally enforceable requirements defined?
>    - Perhaps see &sect;501 and &sect;502 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 351 and 352)
